Supported Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ryzen AI Software Platform supports AMD Ryzen 7040U, 7040HS series mobile processors with Windows 11 OS.

Download the `IPU Driver <https://account.amd.com/en/forms/downloads/ryzen-ai-software-platform-xef.html?filename=ipu_stack_rel_silicon_2308.zip>`_ and install it by following these steps:

1. Extract the downloaded zip file.
2. Open a terminal in administrator mode and execute the ``.\amd_install_kipudrv.bat`` bat file.

Ensure that the IPU driver is installed from ``Device Manager`` -> ``System Devices`` -> ``AMD IPU Device`` as shown in the following image.

Installation Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ryzen AI Software Platform requires using a conda environment (Anaconda or Miniconda) for the installation process. 

Start a conda prompt. In the conda prompt, create and activate an environment for the rest of the installation process. 

.. code-block:: 

  conda create --name <name> python=3.9
  conda activate <name> 

Install Quantizer
#################

Ryzen AI Software platform supports multiple quantization flows. The Vitis AI ONNX Quantization is one of the quickest ways to enable quantization. 

**Vitis AI ONNX Quantization**

Vitis AI ONNX Quantization is a post-training quantization method that works on models saved in the ONNX format. To install it, download the installation file and follow the command:

1. Download the installation file from the following link:

   `Vitis AI ONNX Quantization <https://account.amd.com/en/forms/downloads/ryzen-ai-software-platform-xef.html?filename=vai_q_onnx-1.15.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl>`_

2. Install Vitis AI ONNX Quantization using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install vai_q_onnx-1.15.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl

For other quantization options - Vitis AI PyTorch/TensorFlow 2/TensorFlow Quantization or Olive Quantization, please refer to the :doc:`advanced_installation` page. 


Install ONNX Runtime
####################

.. code-block::
   
   pip install onnxruntime 

Install Vitis AI Execution Provider
###################################

Download and extract the Execution Provider setup package:

https://account.amd.com/en/forms/downloads/ryzen-ai-software-platform-xef.html?filename=voe-4.0-win-amd64.zip 

Change the directory to the extracted Execution Provider setup package directory and install the necessary packages:

.. code-block:: 

     cd voe-4.0-win_amd64\voe-4.0-win_amd64
     python installer.py
     pip install voe-0.1.0-cp39-cp39-win-amd64.whl
     pip install onnxruntime_vitisai-1.15.1-cp39-cp39-win-amd64.whl

Runtime Environment Setup 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
Runtime IPU Binary Selection
############################

The IPU binaries are located inside the Vitis AI Execution Provider package. Selecting an IPU binary is a required step every time the application is run from a new terminal. For example, IPU binary 1x4.xclbin is selected as below 

.. code-block::

   set XLNX_VART_FIRMWARE=C:\path\to\1x4.xclbin

Ryzen AI Software platform provides a couple of IPU binaries (1x4.xclbin and 5x4.xclbin) using different configurations on the IPU device. Refer to the :doc:`advanced_installation` page for more details on IPU binaries.

Runtime Configuration File
##########################

The Execution Provider setup package contains the Vitis AI Execution Provider runtime configuration file ``vaip_config.json``. This file is required when configuring Vitis AI Execution Provider (VAI EP) inside the ONNX Runtime code.


Test Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To quick test this setup download this directory: <link to the directory>

Run the command: 

.. code-block:: 

    python quickstart_resnet50_predict.py --ep ipu


This test will take a image and run classification on IPU. On a sucessful run you will see a output like below:
